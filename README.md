# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

#### The purpose of this election audit analysisi is to autimate the vote counting process through Python. Excel can do this counting process too, but we want this process be more automative so other district can use our method to count the votes too. 
#### Through this analysis, we want to determin who is the winner, how many votes winner gets and what is the percentage of winner votes. 


## Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

### 
 * How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
   ####  
   In total 369,711 votes were casted in the congressional election. 
   
   
   
 * Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
    ####
   Jeferson county received 38,855 votes, which represents 10.5% of total votes.
   
   Denver county received 306,055 votes, which represents 82.8% of total votes.
   
   Aparahoe county received 24,801 votes, which represents 6.7% of total votes. 
   
   
   
 * Which county had the largest number of votes?
 
 ####
      Denver county had the largest number of votes. 
   
   
   
 * Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

####
      Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of total votes, the number of votes were 85,213;
    
      Diana DeGette received 73.8% of total votes, the number of votes were 272,892;
    
      Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of total votes, the number of votes were 11,606.
    
    
    
 * Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

####

      The winning candidate is Diana DeGette. She got 272,892 votes, which represents 73.8% total votes. 
    
 #### Below is the screenshot capture above summary.

## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

###
There are two things I could think of how to modify the current script. 

The first thing is to create a way to check if any duplication record involved in the CSV file. We keep talking about voting fraud in real life, it would be good if script can pick up the duplication of voting ID and see if any ID voted twice for the same candidate. 

The second thing I would suggest is to modify the Python coding to show how many vote each candidate get in each county. Currently this script only shows candidate votes count and percentage in all conties, but not showing each county's details.
